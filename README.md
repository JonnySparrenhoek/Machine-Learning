# Machine-Learning
This is some projects built on concepts used in Machine Learning. The code may not always be optimized as I've used it to try out different stuff
rather than always trying to get the best value possible. For many of the maps I haven't bothered creating a READme as they contain files written in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). Within these files there's descriptions of the programs which can be seen directly through github. 

I do have some additional projects which I've decided not to upload as it
provides solutions for university assignments. Among them is a project I developed with four other students where we trained ghosts in pacman
to catch a pre-trained pacman using approximate Q-Learning, please e-mail me if you're interested in seeing them.

For some of these folders I've used skeleton code and images from other sources which I dont claim ownership for.
