# Self Driving Car

These files was part of an assignment I got during a course in Artificial Intelligence. Most of them were given by the teacher assistent for us to change so that it works. The goal is to make the cars drive through the road in as few steps as possible.

### Installation & Running the program
Other than the normal python libraries you will need pygame to run this program. 
To test the program run the following command: 
```bash
python SearchAgent.py dynamic_configX.txt
```
Where X is your desired environment (1 to 5).
